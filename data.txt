Founded in 1979 by Richard Sears, MICS was the first organization to carry out long-term research on cetaceans in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, and first to carry out long-term studies on&nbsp;the endangered blue whale. The principal study areas include the Qu&eacute;bec North Shore in the Mingan Island/Anticosti region, the Gaspe Peninsula and St Lawrence Estuary.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<h2><span>Research Tourism</span></h2>\r\n<p><span>In order to fund our research, MICS invites the public to participate in our marine mammal studies from June to September every year. Anyone can join us for a day trip or for a week-long immersion, and join biologists in the field and witness what it's like to be a cetacean researcher, observe whale behavior, and better understand marine ecosystems. &nbsp;Our aim is not to offer just another whale-watch, but have you experience our studies first hand, which is the best learning travel can offer.</span></p>\r\n<h2><span>Scientific Research</span></h2>\r\n<p><span>MICS&nbsp;conducts research on populations of blue, humpback, fin, and minke whales in the Gulf of St. Lawrence. MICS&nbsp;is one of the few organizations to have such a long-running research database on these species,&nbsp;which has contributed to hundreds of peer-reviewed publications and has helped government conservation policies.

Fond&eacute;e en 1979 par Richard Sears, la station fut la premi&egrave;re &agrave; mener des recherches &agrave; long terme sur les c&eacute;tac&eacute;s dans le golfe du Saint-Laurent. La principale zone d'&eacute;tude se situe le long de la C&ocirc;te-Nord du Qu&eacute;bec dans la r&eacute;gion de Mingan et de l'&icirc;le d&rsquo;Anticosti.

No veterinarians meant dogs were breeding at will, many dogs were not healthy, many dogs were hungry, increasing number of dogs were aggressive and posing a danger to the communities. Feeding programs and rescuing these animals were only a band aid to the bigger problem. These communities needed to receive proper veterinary services!</p>\r\n<p>The group of three women soon&nbsp;became a group of&nbsp;five&nbsp;and&nbsp;our Northern Spay Neuter Program was born. It started as an extension of The Feeding Program for Northern Dogs, a non- profit group that had been in operation in Thunder Bay for three years. Then it took on a life of its own!</p>\r\n<p>We formed a Facebook group and with invitations and help from community members from Mishkeegogamang and Wunnumin Lake,&nbsp;we set out to fundraise for&nbsp;our first clinic.&nbsp;We also asked for help from individuals and groups who were already offering veterinary clinics in Northeastern Ontario and soon&nbsp;we connected with Dr. Pauline Van Veen from Barrie. She agreed to work with&nbsp;us on&nbsp;our first initiative. The response from other veterinary professionals to&nbsp;our plea for help on Facebook was amazing. And so with Dr. Van Veen, Dr. Jack Hansen and Dr. Calli Thompson and their staff from Northwestern Animal Hospital in Thunder Bay, and veterinary staff from Fort Frances and Sudbury Ontario,&nbsp;we headed for Mishkeegogamang and Wunnumin Lake in September of 2015. Through dog sponsorships and donations from other groups like Finding Them Homes in Barrie,&nbsp;we raised enough money for these two clinics.</p>\r\n<p>Then the requests for clinics began to pour in and&nbsp;NSNP also&nbsp;grew in numbers to now include&nbsp;seven high energy women on our working Board of Directors. More fundraising within communities and by the NSNP&nbsp; resulted in enough funds to support clinics in March of 2016 in Neskantaga and Webequie...and then Gull Bay and Whitesand First Nations in September 2016.</p>\r\n<p>A total of over 300 dogs and cats were spayed or neutered and received examinations, &nbsp;vaccinations, parasite treatment and tattoos between September 2015 and&nbsp;September 2016.</p>\r\n<p>NSNP&nbsp; became a REGISTERED CANADIAN CHARITY on January 1, 2017. Look for ongoing information about upcoming clinics on this site or our<span>&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/849231968477077/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Facebook</a><span>&nbsp;</span>page Northern Spay Neuter Program or contact us at northernspayneuter@gmail.com</p>\r\n<p>Since then NSNP has not looked back. Our clinics in Mishkeegogamang, Wunnumin Lake, Neskantaga, Webequie, Gull Bay, White Sand, Big Grassy River, Sachigo Lake, Lake Helen and Rocky Bay First Nations have allowed us to offer wellness and spay neuter clinics to well over a thousand dogs and cats.... with more to come.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>", "about_fr": "", "logo_en": "/uploads/ik-images/charity/119047/northern-spay-neuter-program-logo_thumbnail_en.png", "logo_fr": "/uploads/ik-images/charity/119047/northern-spay-neuter-program-logo_thumbnail_en.png", "twitter": null, "google_plus": null, "facebook": null, "new_hero_image_en": 129223, "new_hero_image_fr": null, "logo": "/uploads/ik-images/charity/119047/northern-spay-neuter-program-logo_thumbnail_en.png"}, "city_en": "THUNDER BAY", "events_toc_accepted": false, "business_number": "765486725RR0001", "province": "ON", "is_registered": true, "search_image": null, "search_image_fr": null, "summary_en": "NSNP is based in Thunder Bay, Ontario and works with remote First Nation communities to assist with animal management and health issues.
