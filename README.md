small project to make donations easier

Task 1) 
-> Gather information from canadahelps.org to analyse what type of charities we have in Canada
-> Gather the real data on canadian website https://apps.cra-arc.gc.ca/ebci/hacc/srch/pub/bscSrch?q.srchNm=&q.stts=0007&p=1 

Task 2) 
-> Create short algorithm that would help people identity what charities they should be donating money to
-> Identity % of each category to create a "portfolio"

Task 3)
-> See how we could automate the donation part

** Maybe create packages to make it easier as an MVP? aka The Animal Lover, The Enviromentalist, The Philanthropist, The Artist... etc
