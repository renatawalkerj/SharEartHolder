OBBA is a non-profit, membership-driven and inclusive organization representing the interests of all amateur and 'professional' bird banders across Ontario, from organized bird observatories and academic institutions to educational and rehab banders.</p>\r\n<p>The Ontario Bird Banding Association provides a forum for communication among Ontario's banders and those interested in the results of such work. It encourages the training of new banders, serves as a liaison among Ontario's established bird observatories and sponsors special banding-related projects across Canada.</p>\r\n<p>OBBA publishes a Newsletter three times a year that keeps members informed of current events and activities and includes short articles and reports. The Association's annual journal, Ontario Bird Banding, includes reports from Ontario's bird observatories and other articles on banding and recoveries. The Association holds an annual meeting featuring keynote speakers and reports from bird observatories throughout Ontario. OBBA works closely with the North American Banding Council and the Canadian Bird Banding Office and with established bird observatories on the development and delivery of training materials and workshops, bander certification, and education and outreach activities.</p>\r\n<p><strong> OBBA's Objectives are:</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The study of ornithology, especially by means of banding and other marking techniques</li>\r\n<li>The promotion of ornithological investigations and the publication of scientific and educational papers pertaining to those subjects, particularly within the Province of Ontario</li>\r\n<li>Cooperation with organizations with similar objectives</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Among its many accomplishments, in 1960 OBBA proudly founded <a href=\"http://www.birdscanada.org/longpoint/\">Long Point Bird Observatory</a>, North America's first Bird Observatory, which has evolved into <a href=\"http://www.bsc-eoc.org/\">Bird Studies Canada</a>. OBBA has also assisted in the establishment of, and retains close ties with, several other bird observatories in Ontario.</p>\r\n<p><strong><b></b></strong></p>",

Since many villages are near national parks or game reserves, changed attitudes can lead to creased participation in the eco-tourism industry.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">In this way, <strong>bees </strong><em><strong>for</strong></em><strong> babar </strong>hopes to promote and integrate wildlife appreciation and conservation with eco-tourism, increased food security, and supplemented incomes &ndash; by simply investing in bees and beekeeping.</span></p>\r\n<p align=\"center\"><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><span style=\"font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: medium;\">ALL DONATIONS TO&nbsp; BfB GO INTO A ROTATING CREDIT FUND TO PURCHASE MATERIAL FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF HIVES AND BEEKEEPING EQUIPMENT, AND TO TRAIN VILLAGERS IN BEEKEEPING AND RELATED BUSINESS SKILLS.</span></span></strong></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><strong>Low costs lead to big rewards</strong></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">The Society is committed to responsible use of natural resources, including funds earmarked for stewardship of all resources.&nbsp; <strong>bees </strong><em><strong>for</strong></em><strong> babar</strong> is investigating ways to &lsquo;make every dollar count.&rsquo;</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Calibri;\">&nbsp;</span></p>",

With a ban on the use of this persistent toxic chemical in Canada and the U.S. in the early 1970s, coupled with massive conservation efforts, the Peregrine began a steady recovery. Unfortunately, there is continued concern for the welfare of this \"at-risk\" species. DDT is still being used in several countries in Central and South America where the Peregrines winter and birds wintering in South America come north in the spring with toxic chemical residues in their body tissues which can then be passed on to the Peregrines when these birds are taken as prey. Even with all the success Peregrine recovery efforts have enjoyed there are concerns that new classes of chemicals (such as flame retardant) may prove to be injurious to Peregrines and other birds of prey.</p>\r\n<p>Thus, for the Peregrine Falcon, being on top of a food chain has its price. For the human race, the Peregrine, like the proverbial canary in the coal mine, is a barometer of environmental health.</p>\r\n<h2>Bringing them Back</h2>\r\n<p>An international conservation program began in the 1970s in Canada and the U.S. in an attempt to bring back the Peregrine Falcon. A procedure known as \"hacking\" was suggested by experienced falconers as a means of reintroducing young captive-bred peregrines into the wild. Regarded initially as an experiment, the reintroduction program has had success, particularly in urban areas which have the advantage of increased security from predators such as Great Horned Owls and reduced toxic chemical loads in such resident birds as pigeons. Urban releases are also easier to monitor and equally important, they provide an opportunity for the public to watch peregrines living in the wild.</p>\r\n<p>Manitoba's recovery efforts began in 1981 with the release of four captive-bred peregrine falcon chicks in Winnipeg.&nbsp; Since then almost 350 peregrine chicks have hatched or been released as a result of the Project's recovery efforts.</p>\r\n<h2><strong>The Manitoba Peregrine Falcon Recovery Project</strong></h2>\r\n<p>The Project began as a recovery initiative of provincial government in 1981. In 1998, the Project became an independent not-for-profit conservation organization with official charitable status. With the increasing number of \"at-risk\" species and because most of our activities are on-going, we are usually not eligible for grants. The Project is volunteer-driven, relying almost entirely on public donations to support its recovery efforts.</p>",

We also take standardbred horses from feedlots, which is the last stop before slaughter.</p>\r\n<p>We are run completely by a group of like minded volunteers who give their spare time to help these horses return to health, both mentally and physically.</p>\r\n<p>Our training is based on the philosophy of 'Patience and Persistance Pays Off' and you can see how our gentle and relaxed approach to our training program benefits the horses as well as the rider.</p>\r\n<p>We will also be producing an annual&nbsp;horse show&nbsp;to showcase our amazing horses&nbsp;and to let&nbsp;the riding horse world how wonderful these horses are!</p>",

It collaborates willingly with all who share its commitment to fostering a mutually beneficial relationship between people and nature. Strictly non-partisan, it shares a vision of the world in which people are partners and stewards, rather than exploiters. The slogan, &ldquo;Helping Nature Help You&rdquo; exemplifies this ideal.</p>\r\n<h2>About ATLANTIC WILDLIFE INSTITUTE/INSTITUT ATLANTIQUE DE LA FAUNE</h2>\r\n<p>The Atlantic Wildlife Institute, formerly known as Maritime Atlantic Wildlife, was established in 1996, near Sackville, New Brunswick. A provincially and federally licensed wildlife rehabilitation facility, it studies displaced wildlife to determine causes of displacement and integrates its findings with larger issues of environmental education and management. It provides young people with exceptional opportunities for experiential learning about nature. Other AWI programs include: ecological research; safe wildlife handling; consultation and response in wildlife-related emergencies.</p>",

Founded in 1979 by Richard Sears, MICS was the first organization to carry out long-term research on cetaceans in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, and first to carry out long-term studies on&nbsp;the endangered blue whale. The principal study areas include the Qu&eacute;bec North Shore in the Mingan Island/Anticosti region, the Gaspe Peninsula and St Lawrence Estuary.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<h2><span>Research Tourism</span></h2>\r\n<p><span>In order to fund our research, MICS invites the public to participate in our marine mammal studies from June to September every year. Anyone can join us for a day trip or for a week-long immersion, and join biologists in the field and witness what it's like to be a cetacean researcher, observe whale behavior, and better understand marine ecosystems. &nbsp;Our aim is not to offer just another whale-watch, but have you experience our studies first hand, which is the best learning travel can offer.</span></p>\r\n<h2><span>Scientific Research</span></h2>\r\n<p><span>MICS&nbsp;conducts research on populations of blue, humpback, fin, and minke whales in the Gulf of St. Lawrence. MICS&nbsp;is one of the few organizations to have such a long-running research database on these species,&nbsp;which has contributed to hundreds of peer-reviewed publications and has helped government conservation policies. Through our&nbsp;research and collaborations with other scientific institutions around the world, our aim is to further our understanding of these marine mammals in order to better contribute towards their conservation.</span></p>",

No veterinarians meant dogs were breeding at will, many dogs were not healthy, many dogs were hungry, increasing number of dogs were aggressive and posing a danger to the communities. Feeding programs and rescuing these animals were only a band aid to the bigger problem. These communities needed to receive proper veterinary services!</p>\r\n<p>The group of three women soon&nbsp;became a group of&nbsp;five&nbsp;and&nbsp;our Northern Spay Neuter Program was born. It started as an extension of The Feeding Program for Northern Dogs, a non- profit group that had been in operation in Thunder Bay for three years. Then it took on a life of its own!</p>\r\n<p>We formed a Facebook group and with invitations and help from community members from Mishkeegogamang and Wunnumin Lake,&nbsp;we set out to fundraise for&nbsp;our first clinic.&nbsp;We also asked for help from individuals and groups who were already offering veterinary clinics in Northeastern Ontario and soon&nbsp;we connected with Dr. Pauline Van Veen from Barrie. She agreed to work with&nbsp;us on&nbsp;our first initiative. The response from other veterinary professionals to&nbsp;our plea for help on Facebook was amazing. And so with Dr. Van Veen, Dr. Jack Hansen and Dr. Calli Thompson and their staff from Northwestern Animal Hospital in Thunder Bay, and veterinary staff from Fort Frances and Sudbury Ontario,&nbsp;we headed for Mishkeegogamang and Wunnumin Lake in September of 2015. Through dog sponsorships and donations from other groups like Finding Them Homes in Barrie,&nbsp;we raised enough money for these two clinics.</p>\r\n<p>Then the requests for clinics began to pour in and&nbsp;NSNP also&nbsp;grew in numbers to now include&nbsp;seven high energy women on our working Board of Directors. More fundraising within communities and by the NSNP&nbsp; resulted in enough funds to support clinics in March of 2016 in Neskantaga and Webequie...and then Gull Bay and Whitesand First Nations in September 2016.</p>\r\n<p>A total of over 300 dogs and cats were spayed or neutered and received examinations, &nbsp;vaccinations, parasite treatment and tattoos between September 2015 and&nbsp;September 2016.</p>\r\n<p>NSNP&nbsp; became a REGISTERED CANADIAN CHARITY on January 1, 2017. Look for ongoing information about upcoming clinics on this site or our<span>&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/849231968477077/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Facebook</a><span>&nbsp;</span>page Northern Spay Neuter Program or contact us at northernspayneuter@gmail.com</p>\r\n<p>Since then NSNP has not looked back. Our clinics in Mishkeegogamang, Wunnumin Lake, Neskantaga, Webequie, Gull Bay, White Sand, Big Grassy River, Sachigo Lake, Lake Helen and Rocky Bay First Nations have allowed us to offer wellness and spay neuter clinics to well over a thousand dogs and cats.... with more to come.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>",

We rescue animals in cooperation with the Sunchild and O'Chiese First Nations, and have done so for over eight years. </p><p>\r\n</p><p>\r\n</p><p>\r\nPaws and Claws Animal Rescue Foundation also runs a free spay campaign for reserve dogs and cats to prevent many unwanted puppies and kittens from being born to suffer.</p>\r\n<h2>About PAWS AND CLAWS ANIMAL RESCUE FOUNDATION</h2>\r\n<p>\r\nPaws and Claws Animal Rescue Foundation volunteers take needy dogs, puppies, cats and kittens into their own homes and provide loving care until a suitable home is found. </p><p>\r\nVery few animals in this area are spayed and neutered, so the animal population grows exponentially. The statistic is if all a female dog's puppies survive and continue to breed, in five years sixty-five hundred puppies will be born. One cat gives rise to four hundred fifty thousand kittens in seven years.  </p><p>\r\n</p><p>\r\nPrevious to our spay campaign, the only thing that checked the animal population on these two reserves was deaths due to predation, harsh winters, starvation, diseases and parasitic infestations. Paws and Claws Animal Rescue volunteers are dedicated to changing this situation. </p><p>\r\n</p><p>\r\nThree years ago Paws and Claw began a spay program, free to residents on the Sunchild and O'Chiese Reserves. We have spayed approximately three hundred dogs and cats in this time.</p><p>\r\n</p><p>\r\nPlease help us spay more dogs and cats!</p>\r\n",

It is our dream to build a bigger more efficient shelter to meet the growing needs of our city and provide the quality of care the animals deserve.</p>\r\n<p><strong>WE NEED YOUR HELP!</strong></p>\r\n<p>We hope you consider our animal shelter an important part of the community and support us in this endeavor. All donations no matter the amount are gratefully appreciated and get us one step closer to our goal!</p>\r\n<p><strong>Our Vision:</strong> Through the promotion of responsible pet ownership, we will exist primarily to shelter and re-home pets that end up in our care due to unfortunate or uncontrollable circumstances only. To inspire lifelong commitment where animals are treated with empathy, kindness, and respect; free from pain, distress, disease, hunger and thirst.</p>",
